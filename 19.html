        <p>This is a long qoute by <cite>Madara Uchiha</cite></p>
        <blockquote>
            Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed
            world. The longer you live the more you realize that the only 
            things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering
            and futility.
        </blockquote>

        <q>Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
            Learn as if you were to live forever.</q>
